Hi 
@Shravi Jain (Tutor)
 omg so i finished the lab literally last night and i finished it but i never submitted it. is there any way possible that i can still get all the full points without getting a late penalty. it was pretty late last night and since im still sick, my brain was pretty foggy so i guess it literally passed my mind to actually submit it. I was able to get the github pages link working which to myself i guess was done but then i just forgot to submit it. For proof, you can see my last commit 9ab46ce was indeed 8 hours which was before the grace period.
So sorry for the inconvenience. I promise this won't happen again :pray:

hi yeah that's fine, please make a note of this in your submission/readme so that whoever grades it does not dock down points :)
